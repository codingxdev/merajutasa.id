# Methodology Snippet (H0)

Status: Decision Pending

This project applies a non-ranking fairness approach using a hysteresis method (Option F) to avoid churn. The public summary focuses on equity and trust foundations:

- Non-ranking: No league tables; only stability around entry/exit using thresholds.
- Equity index: Published as 1 âˆ’ Gini on the latest snapshot.
- Trust primitives: Credentials are signed (Ed25519) and hashed; chain continuity is verifiable.
- Privacy: PII is scanned; phone/email are redacted; NIK is blocked.

Badge: Decision Pending (Hysteresis narrative and thresholds are being finalized in governance.)
