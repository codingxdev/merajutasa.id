# Deprecated: Using MD as canonical DEC source. This YAML remains temporarily for transition.

id: DEC-20250815-03
status: DRAFT
area: governance

summary: >-
  Adopt updated archive-trace-index-v1.md content and corresponding hash.

context:
  problem: >-
    Trace index changed since last sealed hash; manifest verification flags a DEC-required mismatch.
  evidence:
    - link: docs/governance/trace/archive-trace-index-v1.md
      note: Current file content reflects updated archival mapping.

options:
  - id: adopt-current
    description: >-
      Accept the current content and update the manifest hash under this DEC.
    pros:
      - Aligns manifest to repository state
      - Clears verification failure with governance trace
    cons:
      - Requires governance acknowledgment
  - id: revert
    description: >-
      Revert file to sealed content and keep manifest unchanged.
    pros:
      - No governance update needed
    cons:
      - Discards current edits

decision:
  chosen: adopt-current
  rationale: >-
    Edits are editorial/organizational and improve traceability; adoption is appropriate.
